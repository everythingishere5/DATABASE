1.	Create a report showing last and first names of customers who placed the orders, the order Id, the date on which it placed, 
and the order total, and the last and first names of the salesperson who helped place the order. Since each Customer can have multiple orders, 
the report should be as shown below. Each customer name should be listed only once. Also show the total amount due for each customer as a subtotal in the form. 
Report should be sorted by customer last name.

Note: As the order total of each order is not available yet, create a query to generate the attribute first. 
Hint: Use Report Wizard to create a report. Make sure the customerâ€™s name appearing only once for all the orders he/she placed.
